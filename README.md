# Kongress

Kongress is a companion application for conference attendees.

## Features

The application provides practical information about conferences. It supports conferences that offer their schedule in the [iCalendar](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) format. In Kongress, the data of the talks are shown in various ways, e.g. in daily views, by talk category, etc. The users can also create a list of favorite conference talks as well as they can navigate to the web page of each talk. A map of the conference venue, location information and link to OpenStreetMap can also be added.
